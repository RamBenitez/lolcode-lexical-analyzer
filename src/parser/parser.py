# parser/parser.py

#implement the syntacx analyzer parser for the lolcode
# it takes a list of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer (tokenizer) and
#constructs a parse tree (or AST) representing the program's structure.

#things I have already implemeted
# symbol_table.py manages variable declarations, updates, and lookups during parsing.

# node.py defines the Node class used to build a parse tree for LOLCODE programs.
